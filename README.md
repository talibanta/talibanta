Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Bassirou a Senegalese living in Korea. 

I am interested on Systems Modeling (model-based and data-driven) and their computation with numerical or machine learning methods.


Language Skills: Python / Matlab / Simulink / C / C# / Fortran / Java / Markups: HTML, LaTeX, Markdown / Git

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- - Mathematics (numerical methods, differential equations, linear algebra, probability and statistics);
- - Machine and Deep Learning (dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, specially, PCA technique and Kohonen SOM neural networks);
- - Control Systems and Signal Processing (Simulink, LTI systems, Fourier and Laplace transforms, Arduino);
- - Physics (solid-state physics, dynamical dystems, NMR, quantum computing); 
- - and, of course, Programming (Python, Matlab & Simulink, and some of the relevant languages to the mentionned fields).
- - Some languages I have a basic level with: C, C#, Java, SQL, markup (HTML, LateX, Markdown), Git.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help for a simulation of a full NMR spectrometer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: basskeman@gmail.com, and +82 10 8226 7912.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I drop lines that Vinci can't decode. Yeah, sometimes ðŸ˜„.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page and on some coming-soon repositories..
