Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Bassirou a Senegalese living in Korea. 

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
My interest in computational science are on complex dynamical systems modeling (model-based and data-driven) and their computation (simulation) with numerical or machine learning methods, using mainly Matlab, Python and C++.

**-Computational Materials:** materials informatics based on quantum chemistry methods, interatomic potentials and enhancement with machine learning for atomic, molecular and crystal structures and dynamics calculations and simulations.

**-Computational Devices:**  
**--RF and microwave communication devices:** electromagnetic simulations, signal generator simulation, network parameters calculations, antenna impedance matching, etc.
**--CMOS devices:** quantum transport in heterostructured systems.

**-Computational Physics:**
**--Solid dynamics:** classical mechanics problems
**--Fluid Dynamics:** computational fluid dynamics for the Navier-Stokes equations.

**-Control System:** controller design simulation using Simulink and Arduino

**-Signal Processing:** for analog and digital communication systems

**-NMR Spectroscopy:**
Scripts for automated NMR pulse sequences, signal processing, data acquisition, data processing

**-Quantum Computing:** quantum circuits and algorithms with qiskit

**-Data Processing and Analysis:** machine and deep learning dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, specially, SVD, PCA techniques and Kohonen SOM neural networks.

**-Quantum Machine Learning:** quantum algorithms such as VQE, QAQA, with Qiskit Machine Learning, TensorFlow Quantum, PennyLane, Torch Quantum, etc.


- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help for a simulation of a full NMR spectrometer.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I drop lines that Vinci can't decode. Yeah, sometimes ðŸ˜„.

*ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page and on some coming-soon repositories..*
