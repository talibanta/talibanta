I am interested on Systems Modeling (model-based and data-driven) and their Computation with numerical or machine learning methods.

Skills: Python / Matlab / Simulink / C / C# / C++ / Fortran / Java / Markups: HTML, LaTeX, Markdown / Git

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, numerical methods and quantum machine learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the abovely mentionned topics computed through Python and Matlab (and Simulink).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help for a simulation of a full NMR spectrometer.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- - Mathematics (numerical methods, differential equations, linear algebra, probability and statistics);
- - Machine and Deep Learning (dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, specially, PCA technique and Kohonen SOM neural networks);
- - Control Systems and Signal Processing (Simulink, LTI systems, Fourier and Laplace transforms);
- - Physics (solid-state physics, dynamical dystems, NMR, quantum computing); 
- - and, of course, Programming (Python, Matlab & Simulink, and some of the relevant languages to the mentionned fields).
- - Some languages I have a basic level with: C, C#, Java, SQL, markup (HTML, LateX, Markdown), Git.
