Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Bassirou a Senegalese living in Korea. 

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- In computational science, on complex dynamical systems modeling (model-based and data-driven) and their computation (simulation) with numerical or machine learning methods.

- In Machine and Deep Learning, on dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, specially, SVD, PCA techniques and Kohonen SOM neural networks.

- In Communication Systems (on RF transreceiver design), Control Systems (on data driven controller design) and Signal Processing (analog and digital): mostly applied to NMR instruments using Simulink, Arduino, C++;

-Crystal and molecular structures: visualization, and diffraction pattern generation 
(CrystalMaker, The Materials Project, Atomate)

-Simulation of CMOS devices: Quantum transport based on the drift-diffusion and Poisson models in diodes, quantum wells, transistors, using simulation softwares with built-in numerical solvers (nextnano, NESS, FEnICS, Elmer, COMSOL (free trial)) 

- In Coding: To these mentionned fields, here are some relevant languages for which I have a very modest level: Python, Matlab, C++, Fortran, markups (HTML, LateX, Markdown), Git, Processing.


- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help for a simulation of a full NMR spectrometer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: basskeman@gmail.com.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I drop lines that Vinci can't decode. Yeah, sometimes ðŸ˜„.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page and on some coming-soon repositories..
