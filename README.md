Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Bassirou a Senegalese living in Korea. 

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- - In computational science, I am interested on complex dynamical systems modeling (model-based and data-driven) and their computation (simulation) with numerical or machine learning methods.
- - Mathematics (applied to dynamical dystems: differential equations, numerical methods, linear algebra);
- - Machine and Deep Learning (dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, specially, SVD, PCA techniques and Kohonen SOM neural networks);
- - Communication Systems (RF transreceivr design), Control Systems (data driven controller design) and Signal Processing (analog and digital): all applied to NMR instruments using Simulink, Arduino, C++);
- - Physics (the basics of modern physics, solid-state physics, NMR Spectroscopy, functional materials and devices);
- - Spin qubit quantum and neuromorphic computing
- - Coding: To these mentionned fields, here are some relevant languages for which I have a very modest level: Python, Matlab, C++, Fortran, markups (HTML, LateX, Markdown), Git, Processing.


- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help for a simulation of a full NMR spectrometer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: basskeman@gmail.com.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I drop lines that Vinci can't decode. Yeah, sometimes ðŸ˜„.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page and on some coming-soon repositories..
