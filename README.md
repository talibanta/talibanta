### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ì•ˆë…•í•˜ì„¸ìš”
I am Bassirou. I am interested on Modeling and Computation of Complex Systems. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on computational and machine learning methods for dynamical systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, numerical methods and quantum machine learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the abovely mentionned topics computed through Python and Matlab (and Simulink).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help for a simulation of a full NMR spectrometer.


- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- - Mathematics (numerical methods, differential equations, linear algebra, probability and statistics);
- - Machine and Deep Learning (dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, specially, PCA technique and Kohonen SOM neural networks);
- - Control Systems and Signal Processing (Simulink, LTI systems, Fourier and Laplace transforms);
- - Physics (solid-state physics, dynamical dystems, NMR, quantum computing); 
- - and, of course, Programming (Python, Matlab & Simulink, and some of the relevant languages to the mentionned fields).
- - Some languages I have a basic level with: C, C#, Java, SQL, markup (HTML, LateX, Markdown), Git.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: basskeman@gmail.com, and +82 10 8226 7912.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His


- âš¡ Fun fact: I drop lines that Da Vinci can't code. Yeah, sometimes ðŸ˜„.
